# CFG Python Course Project
The final project I created whilst undertaking the Introduction to Python Programming course run by Code First Girls. It is a spreadsheet analysis project investigating sleep data. The project was presented to the rest of the course remotely via [this video](https://youtu.be/xtfNSMlx9Xg). I won best spreadsheet analysis project and best overall project.

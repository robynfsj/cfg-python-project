# CFG Python Course Project

I undertook the Introduction to Python Programming course run by Code First Girls during spring 2020. It was my first experience of Python. The course took place one evening a week for 8 weeks and covered the following topics:

* data types and variables  
* loops  
* functions  
* if statements 
* comparison and logical operators
* lists and dictionaries
* APIs

## Course Project
This repository contains my final project that I created as a requirement of the course. It is a data analysis project investigating sleep data. The project was presented to the rest of the course remotely via [this video](https://youtu.be/xtfNSMlx9Xg). I won best spreadsheet analysis project and best overall project.

Installs required: 
* matplotlib  
* pyfiglet
